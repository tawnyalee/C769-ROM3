To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, see the [task 2 examples](resources:examples).

Not sure where to start? Students often begin with the summary, A1-A3, but it might be easier to summarize a completed paper. Consider doing these last. Section F2 is a great place to begin. It can be written in bullet-point format and inherently outlines critical elements of the entire paper.

:::{tip}
Sections are assessed independently against the rubric requirements, i.e., when evaluating a section, the evaluator will check for fulfilling the requirements within that section. They *don't* assess writing style. You can (and sometimes must) reuse content from other areas as needed. It's not about writing something fun to read but demonstrating you've met the requirements.
:::

```{admonition} Do NOT write an outline!
:class: error
Most must be written in a narrative style with complete sentences and paragraphs. Tables and bullet points are acceptable for sections F1, F2, and G.

## A: Proposal Overview

We created this video for ROM2, but it is still relevant for ROM3.
:::

The Proposal Overview has three parts:

1. The Problem Summary (A1)
2. The IT Solution (A2)
3. The Implementation Plan (A3 and A3a)

Evaluators will not assess your writing style, but you should write for an uninformed reader -the client needing your expertise. Explain what's wrong with their situation, why your solution is the fix, and how you'll implement it.

Keeping an uninformed reader in mind may help you understand why the Proposal Overview could extend to several pages. Imagine explaining the project to a non-technical friend. Adopting more accessible language requires explaining terms and concepts customarily taken for granted, which creates content. Also, WGU evaluators need to understand the problem at hand, the organizational environment in which it exists, what might or might not work as a solution, and how you will implement the solution. These sections introduce them to your project and provide the context by which they assess other areas.

```{tip}
- Write these sections last to ensure your overview accurately summarizes your project. 
- The required depth of detail is up to the *subjectivity* of the evaluator. Though summaries are typically short, there is no penalty for *too much* detail.
```

### A1: Problem Summary

Summarize the IT problem. Provide context to understand the problem, e.g., details about the client and their situation. For example, are there multiple locations? What is the size of the company? What industry are they in? Explain how their problem is impacting daily operations.

### A2: IT Solution

Summarize the solution and why the solution will fix the problem from A1. Be specific. Avoid phrases, such as "such as," "like," or "including," because it implies a partial list. Instead, tell the reader exactly what hardware and/or software is being implemented. Don't just state that you will upgrade the network. Give us enough detail in what you are implementing that someone could possibly generate a purchase order for all the hardware/software needed for the project based on your IT Solution alone. Use direct, declarative language. Avoid writing the 'we should do this' type of response. Instead, use language that makes it clear this is the solution, such as "We will be doing this."

### A3: Implementation Plan

Descibe the implemetation plan detailed in section E (Methodology). This section should:

- Describe the *specific steps* for how the plan will be implemented (this section should repeat *E: Methodology*).
- Identify who will implement each step.

### A3a: Justification of Plan

Justify why the implementation plan from A3 is appropriate, e.g., why do this plan instead of another one? It's best to address this requirement in a separate section. When forming your justification, ask yourself the following questions. Do some tasks have prerequisites? Is the project methodology suited to the project type? Are some aspects critical to success, and if so, how? Answering these questions will help you formulate a justification for your plan. Refer directly to the type of IT Solution you are implementing when you write your justification. Avoid being too generic.

Though A1-A3a are overview sections, they are often returned for being too brief -particaulatly A3. There is no penalty for being too long, and you are allowed to reuse content from other sections.

## B and B1: Review of Other Work & Works Informing Design

:::

Think of this section as a literature review where you summarize a work (part B) and then relate it to your project (B1). The works *only need to connect to an aspect of your project*; they don't need to align with your project entirely. You use anything an industry professional created, e.g., online articles, videos, vendor documentation, whitepapers, etc. Most importantly, you must have **four** different works cited with an in-text citation, e.g., (Smith, 2021).

1. **Summarize the work.** tell your reader what the work is about; there is no need to offer an opinion or analyze it -simply summarize the content. We recommend 1-2 paragraphs per work. 
2. **Include an in-text citation,** e.g., (Author, year) for [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date). Consider using a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources).
3. **Relate the work to your project.** Following the summary, describe how the work expands the context of the problem or supports the implementation solution. We recommend at least one paragraph per work. 

<!-- - [WGU's library](https://wgu.libguides.com/friendly.php?s=library)
- [google.scholar.com](https://scholar.google.com/) -->

:::{tip}
Stuck? Return to this section later. You will likely collect sources while conducting research for other sections. Hang on to any extras; you'll need *three different* works for Task 3.

The work is not expected to be a one-to-one match for your project. What's accepted is very broad.

## C: Project Rationale

The **Project Rationale** provides a comprehensive picture of *why* the project is needed and *why* it is feasible. Let the reader know the possible consequences if the project is not implemented.

To rationalize the need, describe the business, technical, user needs, and internal or external environmental factors. Consider including an example illustrating how the project will help. To rationalize the project's feasibility, consider factors such as time, resources, and expertise.

## D: Current Project Environment

For this section, do the following:  

- Discuss how the solution from A2 will improve the client's approach to achieving its goals (strategy).
- Discuss how the solution from A2 will align with (or at least not contradict) the client's beliefs and values (culture).

'Environment' is an umbrella which includes 'strategy' and 'culture.' Use both these words in your description. It won't hurt to contrast the solution from A2 with the existing IT infrastructure relevant to the problem.

## E: Methodology

In this section, you must do the following:

1. Identify a "standard" methodology for project planning, e.g., ADDIE or SDLC.
2. Describe the planned project steps in each phase of the methodology, e.g., analysis, design, etc. Tell us which steps belong in each phase. 

Step 2 provides a detailed implementation plan, as outlined in section A2. If using a less-known methodology, relate it to a "standard" one.

(task2:F)=

## F: Goals, Objectives, & Deliverables

This section has two parts, F1 and F2.

- F1. Provide a table outlining project goals, objectives, and deliverables.
- F2. Separate from the table, describe each listed goal and objective.

At a minimum, there should be one goal, each goal should have two objectives, and each objective has one deliverable. Here's an example of what this might look like:

**Goals** and **objectives** are very similar. Goals are broader, defining the end you are trying to achieve (e.g., improving customer service). You need at least one goal. Objectives are more specific, often measurable steps supporting the goal (e.g., real-time inventory updates for customers). Goals and objectives can be considered high-level and mid-management tasks, respectively. **Deliverables** are tangible tasks supporting the objectives (e.g., an inventory status screen reporting real-time inventory to customers). Details to include in discussing deliverables could be the role responsible for the deliverable and how the deliverable will be created/executed.

:::

Create a table providing the *Duration*, *Projected start date*, and *Projected end date* for each milestone and deliverable. No additional information is needed.

|Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
--- | --- | ---| ---|
|Some milestone |7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
|Some deliverable |14 days|7/16/2022|7/30/2022|
|$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

```{note}
*All* dates must be in the future. Task 2 is a proposal. Write as if you are trying to convince the client to adopt your plan. Even if based on an already completed project, write Task 2 as a yet-to-be-completed project
```

(task2:H)=

## H: Outcome

Provide objective, measurable criteria for success. You need specific details so that the conclusion report, task 3, can comparatively be used to show the project was a success. Furthermore, describe how data will be collected and measured to support the criteria. Include the following:

- A metric for determining success.
- A description of how the metric's data will be collected.
- A description of how the metrics data will be measured.  

Time-based metrics work best, for example:

>...This project will be considered a success when the wireless network maintains 90% uptime a week for a month and 75% of new member and loan documentation is processed through the credit union.

>...This project will be a success if user satisfaction is high. 4 weeks after the implementation, we will send out a survey to users. After two weeks, we will tally responses. Our goal is to achieve 70% user satisfaction.

In the above examples, we tell the metric (user satisfaction/network performance), how we will measure it (survey after 4 weeks/uptime calculations), and our goal (70% satisfaction/90% a week).

Sometimes students struggle to know how they would claim their project is a success. One way of selecting a good metric is to ask yourself how you would test what you just installed to know it worked properly. Can the appropriate users access the appropriate resources? Are auto-generated emails reaching their destination? Does it function as expected? Make your test your metric.

(task2:grammar)=

## Professional Communication and Sources

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions! Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769-ROM3/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Get your [FREE Gramamrly education license](https://www.grammarly.com/edu/western-governors-university) through WGU.  

Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) can prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. For more details, see:

-[Help with Professionl Commnication](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Coaching-Center/I-Need-Help-with-Professional-Communication/ta-p/23355)

Sources and format should consistenely follow a recognized academic writing style. We recommend [APA $7^{\text{th}}$ edition guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org). Outside of grammar mistakes, most style errors involve formatting of the sources or in-text citations. For APA, in-text citations should be of the form `(Author, year)`. For more details, see [APA guidelines for citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations).

Avoid reference errors by using a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources):

- [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) $\leftarrow$ desktop version only.

## FAQ

### I've completed task 2. Should I send it to my course instructor for review?

If you have specific questions or concerns, then yes. However, in most cases, it's best to submit. What suffices as "sufficient detail" is highly subjective. We can always tell you to add more, but if you've done your best to fulfill the requirements, submit it and let them tell you which (if any) parts need to be rewritten. At best, it passes; at worst, we address the issues cited by the evaluator -and then it passes. Responding to the more narrow focus of the evaluator's comments is generally easier than overworking the entire project.

You have *unlimited* submissions but limited time. Typically, this is the best and most efficient approach.

### I see some suggestions about writing lengths. Is there a required number of pages?

No. Those are just suggestions. The individual evaluator determines what qualifies as "sufficient detail," and this judgment will vary depending on your project and writing style. If you feel the requirements are met, move on to the next section. Upon submission, it will pass, or they will request more details.

### How many submission attempts do I have?

You have unlimited submissions (as with all WGU performance assessments). Furthermore, a project requiring multiple submissions is not precluded from being given an excellence award. However, do attempt to fully meet *each* requirement, as submissions falling significantly short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Moreover, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments.

### I can't find sources for section B, *Other Works*. What can I do?

You are likely overinterpreting what's required. Rarely are submissions sent back because cited works are unsuitable. You can use any citable work created by a professional that can be *related* to your project -it does not need to align with your project entirely. For example, a cloud migration project might include articles about AWS, security advantages, cost advantages, etc.

### My task was returned for "In-text citations could not be found..."

**My task two was returned for *sources* stating:**
> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased..."
**What does this comment mean?**

This comment indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following an approved writing style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use a [referencing tool](resources:general:grammar:sources) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors. Follow the in-text citations and the reference page format of the [tasks 2 and 3 examples](resources:examples).

### What if I start writing task 2 and want to change things? Do I need to resubmit task 1?

No. Minor changes from task 1 to task 2 are expected and allowed *without updating the approval form*. Evaluators will not rigorously compare Tasks 1 and 2. Task 2 is where the majority of your work will be, and even with complete topic changes, you might at most need to revise the approval form (if at all). So, never let Task 1 dictate what you do in Task 2. However, deviating significantly from what was approved could put you at risk of completing a project that cannot meet the requirements. So, while minor changes do not need review, discuss significant changes with your assigned course instructor.

### Are the appendices required?

No, not for Task 2. You can remove them from the template if you don't need them.
